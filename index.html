          <h2>A Catalog of Music Hardware Projects</h2>
          <p><em>MuzHack is first and foremost a catalog of independent music hardware projects.
          </em></p>
          <img src="images/catalog.png" width="790" height="420" />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Sharing of Designs</h2>
          <p><em>The second underlying idea of MuzHack is to facilitate the sharing of music hardware
          designs.</em></p>
          <p>Not only should people be able to find cool musical devices, they should also
            be able to understand how to reproduce them if they want to (and the author is
            prepared to share).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>MuzHack is Free and Open</h2>
          <p>MuzHack is an <em>open</em> platform, in that anyone can join the platform (for free)
            and post projects to their heart's content.</p>
          <p>This is an important principle, as it should be a platform for the <em>community</em>
            as a whole.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>MuzHack is Open Source</h2>
          <p><em>MuzHack's source code is freely available.</em></p>
          <p>As the goal is to have a collaborative, community-driven, environment around MuzHack,
            the source code is released under a permissive license (MIT) on the popular
            source code hosting service GitHub.</p>
          <p>This should hopefully encourage useful contributions from volunteers. It also means
            that maintenance of MuzHack can continue even if the original developer should leave.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Projects Include Build Instructions</h2>
          <p>If the author so chooses, a MuzHack project provides user friendly instructions
            for how to build the hardware yourself.</p>
          <p>Having easy instructions for building devices yourself opens for some great
          educational potential, as it empowers people to understand themselves how their
          devices work and they might even be able to customize them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Projects Can be Imported from GitHub</h2>
          <p>In addition to the standard workflow of creating projects directly on MuzHack,
            through a visual interface, you have the option to import them from GitHub.</p>
          <p>This workflow saves you from the work of having to maintain a duplicate version
            of your project (i.e. on MuzHack), and allows you to e.g. generate your own
            website from the same data. When you make changes to your GitHub repository,
            MuzHack automatically synchronizes the corresponding project.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Workshops</h2>
          <p>Another idea underpinning the MuzHack project is to facilitate and organize
            workshops.
          </p>
          <p>Building stuff together with other people is just more fun!
          </p>

          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Youtube videos and sound snippets to demonstrate devices</li>
            <li>User friendly BOMs with links to purchase components</li>
            <li>Marketplace to buy components/kits/assembled products</li>
            <li>Social network capabilities</li>
            <li>Comments on projects</li>
            <li>Project ratings</li>
            <li>Ability to fork ("remix") projects</li>
            <li>Announcements of project related workshops</li>
            <li>Curated content</li>
